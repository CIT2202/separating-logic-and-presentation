## Separating logic and presentation
Previously we looked at creating a core database driven web functionality using a films database (a browseable list, inserting a new film etc.).

This repository contains the same 'browseable list' PHP page, however, it has been re-written to separate the application logic (working with the database) from the presentation (HTML, echo statements etc.). Have a good look at this example.

* Using your previous PHP practical work (from Week 4:Part A). Can you re-write the PHP to do something similar i.e. use includes to remove duplicate code.

* To start with, focus on the *browseable-list.php* page. You can use the example in this repository to guide you.

* Then try and do something similar for the *details.php* page, and for *create* and *save*.
