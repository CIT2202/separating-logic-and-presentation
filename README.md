# Separating logic and presentation
This practical considers how we can use ```include``` to remove duplicate code from a database driven PHP web application.

## Setting up
Previously we looked at creating database driven web functionality using a films database (a browseable list, inserting a new film etc.).
* Make sure you have a working copy of this practical work from Week 4: PartB. If you didn't finish this practical work you can find a working version at https://github.com/CIT2202/films-single-table-crud/tree/solutions (you will need to change the database settings so this works with your database). 
* Make sure this works before doing the next steps.

## Removing duplicate code
* Can you re-write the PHP code in this films example to use ```include``` to remove duplicate code.
  * To start with, focus on the *browseable-list.php* page. You can use the example in this repository to guide you.
* Then try and do something similar for the *details.php* page, and for *create* and *save*.
